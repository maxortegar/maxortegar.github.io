            Dear Eileen,<br><br> thank you for recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br> of your PhD nest year. I will aswer your questions one by one, int the following sections.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a>Starting dates</a><br><br> We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
            <br>
            <br> You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a>Subjects of study</a>
            <br>
            <br> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> the kind
            of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:<br><br>
            <ol>
                <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
                </li>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
            <br>
            <a>Exotic dance moves</a>
            <br>
            <br> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            <br>
            <br> Polynesian chicken dance<br>
            <dd>
                A little known bt <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
            </dd>
            <br> Icelandic brownuan shuffle<br>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br> tiny, very rapid
                movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> modern styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>
            <br> Arctic robot dance<br>
            <dd>
                An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern Alaska and
                Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.
